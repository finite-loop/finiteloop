                        <p class="text-xl">The Aerosol Box is a device that protects medical personnel from the patient's aerosolized respiratory droplets during any Aerosol Generating Procedures.
                        ‍<br />
                        Going forward, every Intensive or Critical care doctor runs the risk of being exposed to any aerosol borne pathogen. Along with PPE, the AeBox acts a shield preventing 
                        doctors from catching the infection from patients during their rapid response. Barriers like these are likely to be standard protocol in the post-COVID era.
